A new and popular coffee-chain from Newyork wants to set up a few branches in London.
It wants to explore all the neighbourhoods in London based on the types of venues in each neighbourhood
and target those locations which are not already overcrowded with caffes and coffee shops , but still have decent amount of venues 
in the neighbourhood, plus has good connectivity with train and bus(based on train stations and bus stops in the neighbourhood).

So the full project involves finding the list of neighbourhoods of London, finding the location coordinates for each, finding upto 50 
venues in each neighborhood in a radius of 500 metres and classifying/clustering the neighbourhoods based on most frequently
occuring venues in each neighbourhood.
